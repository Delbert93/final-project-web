final project web

This is the final project for kaydon and Mckinnin for their web design course. 
The project is the start of a college based portfolio organizer and display. The aim is to create a 
beautify display that works for all work done in a college or technical field that would be used later 
in a portfolio.
The portfolio is to help students, graduates and employeers find and connect with each other without
the hasle of lugging arround a physical portfolio.
